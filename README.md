# Test Driven Devlopment- Bowling Game Kata


🤔 What is a kata?

🥋A Kata in martial arts means “a system of individual training exercises”. Just like in martial arts, coding also requires consistent practise to hone in the skill.
What is the goal?
Plan out and spend 30-45 minutes having a go at the Bowling Game Kata using Test-Driven Development. It is not expected to have a finished solution but have had a good go at using Test-Driven Development.


🗒️ Instructions

👉 Read the Bowling Game Kata requirements. You can find it in the following link: https://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/ at Coding Dojo.


## TDD Approach 

* Use the Triple A Structure - Arrange, Act, Assert to guide you when writing your unit tests

* Use the RED - GREEN - REFACTOR cycle: Write one failing test first and write the simplest code to make that test pass, then see if there is any opportunity to refactor. If not, move onto writing your next test and follow the cycle through as you build up your solution.

* Remember to consider a range of different test cases and edge cases.

### Parameters to consider

* A Bowling game consists of ten frames
* Each frame has two rolls
* There are three types of frames:
    - OPEN frame: where both rolls do not add up to 10.
    - SPARE frame: where both rolls add up to 10.
    - STRIKE frame: where the first, and only roll, is a 10.
